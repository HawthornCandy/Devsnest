   <div> Re: Updated Billing Frequency </div><p>

<div>Dear <b>Ms.Sarah,</b> </div>
<p>
    I am writing to inform you of our new pricing model effective February 1, 2019. On the first of February, we will be switching from an annual billing cycle to a quarterly billing cycle and this letter contains important information that may impact your organization.
After conducting extensive research and receiving feedback from our customers, we have determined that most customers strongly prefer a quarterly billing cycle rather than an annual one. In order to best suit your needs, we have decided to offer this benefit, which will take effect on February 1, 2019.
This letter is simply to notify you of the upcoming changes, and no immediate action is required from you at this time. We thank you for your continued business.

    <p><br>Please contact us agin if we can help in any way.<br><br>    
</p>
Yours Sincerely,<br>
    <div><b><em>Saheli Kundu</em></b></div>
    <div><b>Director of <em>ABC Education Inc.</em></b></div>
